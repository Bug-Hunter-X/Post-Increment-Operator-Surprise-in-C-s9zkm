# Post-Increment Operator Surprise in C

This example demonstrates a common but subtle error involving the post-increment operator (`x++`) in C. The code appears simple, but its output may be unexpected for those not fully understanding how the post-increment operator works in the context of multiple evaluations within a single expression or statement.

The `bug.c` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version and explanation. 

This is a great example to illustrate the importance of paying close attention to operator precedence and order of evaluation to avoid unexpected behaviour in your programs.
